# Zomato-Analysis
EDA of Zomato restaurants in Bangalore using functions in Python ( Jupyter Notebook )

This is a live dataset from the Zomato App that contains a list of restaurants in Bangalore with unwanted data. Using Python, we create a function to remove unwanted data from a dataset.

This dataset has 56255 rows and 13 columns.


The data cleaning procedure is divided into seven steps: 
Step 1: Remove any unnecessary columns. 
Step 2: Rename the columns to facilitate analysis. 
Step 3: Handling null values in each column 
Step 4: Remove duplicate values 
Step 5: Remove all of the irrelevant text from each column. 
Step 6: Checking for unique values and dealing with those that aren't 
Step 7: Remove the dataset's special characters

Finally, we conduct our analysis using SQL queries.
